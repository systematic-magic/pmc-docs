Getting started
===============

Welcome to the PMC corrections documentation!

In this document we separate articles into two big groups:

1. :ref:`All papers (except Editorials and News)<title_research_papers>`
2. :ref:`Editorials and News<title_editorials_news>`

The scope of checks varies greatly between these two groups. And therefore, it is important to know which group you are dealing with when you are reviewing the article.

Below we will show you how to know the group article belongs to:

1. Get to the article page.
- Go to :ref:`www.oncotarget.com`<oncotarget>

2. Take a look at TOC Section Title (see screenshot below).

   :alt: TOC Section Title


- If you see there "News" or "Editorials", then go :ref:`here<title_editorials_news>` to check review instructions.

- If you see there something else (NOT "News" or "Editorials"), then go :ref:`here<title_research_papers>`.
