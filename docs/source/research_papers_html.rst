Check whether those references were moved from Advanced Publications section to the specific issue and have full-citation data available.

- Go to corresponding article page on Oncotarget site (either use search or resolve DOI)

- If full citation-data is not present on article page, then leave references as it is. No action is necessary.

- If full citation-data is present, then suggest correction to include full citation-data to the reference.
